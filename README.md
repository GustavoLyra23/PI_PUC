Cart√£o Vacina PUC
The program simulates a virtual vaccination card where the user can record the vaccines they have taken and check which ones they still need to take. Here's how it works:

Start of the Program: Upon running the program, the user is prompted to provide their name and age. This is necessary to create a personalized vaccine record for the patient.

Recording Vaccines: Next, the program presents a list of pre-defined vaccines such as COVID-19, Hepatitis B, Tetanus, and Influenza. For each vaccine, the user is prompted to input how many doses they have already taken.

Display of Vaccines Taken: After recording the vaccines, the program displays a list of vaccines that the patient has already taken, along with the dose count for each.

Display of Remaining Vaccines: Additionally, the program shows a list of vaccines that the patient still needs to take and how many doses remain for each, assuming each vaccine has between 3 and 5 doses.

End of Program: After displaying the information, the program terminates its execution.

In summary, the program allows the user to record their vaccines, check which ones they have already taken, and which ones they still need to take, providing an easy way to track their vaccination history and take care of their health.
